![Puzzal](puzzle.jpg)

Identifying customer segments is beneficial for selecting profitable customers and developing customer loyalty. RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis is a simple technique for behaviour based customer segmentation. It is used to determine quantitatively which customers are the most valuable ones by examining:

## how recently a customer has purchased (recency),
## how often they purchase (frequency),
## how much the customer spends (monetary).
